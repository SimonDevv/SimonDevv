# 👋 Hi, I'm Simon  
**Developer · Python · Automation · Web · Multiplatform**

I'm a developer focused on building practical tools that save time and solve real problems:
automations, scrapers, small APIs, and clean web interfaces.  
I have a strong foundation from my Multiplatform App Development studies (DAM), working with
Python, Java, C#, Unity, SQL, HTML/CSS and more.

My goal is to grow as a remote freelancer and build useful, real-world projects.
